# ConnectFour
This is a basic connect four game with a non-fixed board size. The command line prompts for the two player's names, then how many they want to have to get in a row to win (between 3 &amp; 6). The users then choose columns to place their pieces until either a winner is decided based on the basic connect four rules, or a tie occurs.
